### [Blur Image Detect Model](https://github.com/SummitXY/DMAI/tree/master/blur-detect-model)

You can chose one of three models to train:

 	1. Single Convolution Layer
 	2. Single Residual block
 	3. ResNet18

### [Python Utils](https://github.com/SummitXY/DMAI/tree/master/python-toys)

Most of them use `os` and `shutil` package to operate file system
